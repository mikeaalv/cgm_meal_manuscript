## Dependencies
Please refer to the [supplementary files](To be added soon) for the R and Python environment. The scripts have been tested on Mac OS.

## Installation
Please clone the code and run.

## Demo
We provide a demo on CGM processing and feature extraction. The processed and smoothed CGM data can be found [here](To be added soon). The user can run `cgm/feature_extraction/manual_feature.py` and `cgm/visualization/figures_cgm_features.py` in order to extract CGM features and visualize the features. Required time for downloading and running should be brief.
